# aelna354's PyChess Game

A chess game I made in Python 3 using Tkinter. After my successes in creating both my YouTube-DL GUI and the Autoclicker in Tkinter, I thought it'd be fun to do this. Unlike those other projects, this one is made purely for recreation and doesn't have any practical intentions; it's not something I intend to use as I'm honestly not a big fan of chess.

This is a chess game designed to simulate a game of chess. Rules are as follows: 8x8 board. Each player can move one of their pieces per turn.

* Pawns: can move forward one space (two spaces if they haven't moved yet).
* Rooks: can move in any direction horizontally or vertically (but not both at once).
* Bishop: can move in any diagonal direction.
* Queen: can move in any diagonal, vertical or horizontal direction.
* King: can move one space in any diagonal, vertical or horizontal direction.
* Knights: can move in an L-shape (two vertical, one horizontal, or two horizontal, one vertical).

With Python 3 installed, all you have to do is download app.cmd and chess.py, and double click app.cmd to launch the game.
